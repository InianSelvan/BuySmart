# BuySmart
AI based product comparision website

BuySmart is a best in class product-price comparison website which is little different from any other typical product comparison websites. It allows the users to search for the products in websites of their choice and help them to compare the prices and decide on the best place to buy the product. Our system uses Artificial Intelligence to do the sentiment analysis on all the user reviews across all the websites and gives a consolidated review score on the product features. The system is deployed on a cloud based PaaS to have persistent availability and reliability.

It is deployable as docker in open-shift
